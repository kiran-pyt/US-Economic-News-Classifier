# US-Economic-News-Classifier

In this project, I developed a classifier to categorize US economic news articles into relevant and non-relevant groups. Using Python, I employed various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve this goal

Overview
The project involved several key steps:

**Data Preprocessing:.**

Initially, I cleaned and prepared the dataset by removing irrelevant data and HTML tags. I also eliminated URLs, punctuations, digits, and stopwords from the text, and applied lemmatization to normalize the text data.

**Feature Extraction:** 

I utilized TF-IDF vectorization, a common technique in NLP, to convert the text data into numerical features. Additionally, I experimented with Count Vectorization and Hashing Vectorization for comparison purposes.
